# MedHelper
Designed to help people who have to take drugs for a long time.
Once the project is up and running, the usr is asked to provide dates and time of day when the drug in the container should be dispensed, then at the set time, a buzzer sounds for about 5 seconds with a red led light on the machine.
When the person puts his hand under the bin, the red led goes off and the green one lights up, while the motor turns 180 degrees to drop the pill into his hand.
If the sensor does not "see" something under it, withing a minimalistic range of 5 cms, the motor will not start and the pill will not drop but will stay inside the container to keep it from humidity and whatever external factors that might affect its consistency.

Team Members are :
* GHOSN Chadi
* JALBOUT Nehme

PS. The final project might look a little different cause we are still arranging the wires dispostion and some minor modifications that will not affect the aim or the general appearance of the project.
